# Python Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains Python implementations of common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed to help developers, students, and enthusiasts understand and practice foundational concepts in computer science.

## Features
- **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables
- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Recursion Examples

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No additional libraries are required for most implementations. Some graph-related algorithms might require the `networkx` library (optional).

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/python-dsa.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Folder**:
   ```
   cd python-dsa
   ```
3. **Run Examples**:
   - Navigate to a specific folder (e.g., `sorting` for sorting algorithms).
   - Run the desired script using:
     ```
     python script_name.py
     ```
4. **Modify and Practice**:
   - Edit the scripts to add new test cases or customize them for better understanding.

## Code Structure
- **Folder Organization**: Each data structure or algorithm has its own folder with relevant implementations.
- **Readable Code**: Each script includes comments explaining the logic and steps.
- **Example Usage**: Some scripts have a `main()` function showcasing example usage or test cases.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions! Feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, improvements, or new algorithms. Please include comments and test cases for any new code added.
